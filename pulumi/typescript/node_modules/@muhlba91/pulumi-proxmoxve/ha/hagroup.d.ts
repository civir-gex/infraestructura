/**
 * Manages a High Availability group in a Proxmox VE cluster.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as proxmoxve from "@muhlba91/pulumi-proxmoxve";
 *
 * const example = new proxmoxve.ha.HAGroup("example", {
 *     group: "example",
 *     comment: "This is a comment.",
 *     nodes: {
 *         node1: undefined,
 *         node2: 2,
 *         node3: 1,
 *     },
 *     restricted: true,
 *     noFailback: false,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * #!/usr/bin/env sh
 *
 * HA groups can be imported using their name, e.g.:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import proxmoxve:HA/hAGroup:HAGroup example example
 * ```
